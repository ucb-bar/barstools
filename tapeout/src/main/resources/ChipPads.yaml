# Pad types must be one of digital, analog, or supply; pad names must be unique!
# This just shows you how you can template things with {{}}, if/else,  and the following parameters:
# isInput: Boolean (each digital pad entry should be configurable between both input and output)
# isHorizontal: Boolean (each pad entry should be configurable between both horizontal and vertical)
# NOTE: Expects 1-bit in/out to be named in/out for digital; and 1-bit io for analog (supplies don't have ports)
# Expects module name to be obtained from {{name}} which is derived from yaml name, tpe in the Firrtl pass
# Pipe is used for stripping margins, but indentation is required before the pipe for the yaml reader to work
